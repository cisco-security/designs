Cisco ASA failover pair & two standalone FTD FPR4150s with Nexus5548 switches in vPC
========================================================
Posted configuration files showcase how to use FPR4100 appliances and Nexus5000 switches,
and build a resilient NGFW design with ASA Failover and stand-alone FTD inline-IPS appliances.
Failover link between ASAs is crossconnected with a cable between Eth1/8 ports. 
To help with review of this setup, number of videos will be created on YouTube.

Here are the configurations included:

Two Nexus5000 switches in vPC (virtual port-channels match up to spanned port-channels on ASA/FTD)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nexus5548-sw1.cfg
nexus5548-sw2.cfg

Two Firepower4100 appliances in ASA cluster - Multiple contexts, all in routed firewall mode
